// Per-segment compiled variants of static game code
// (docs/SEGMENT_AWARE_CODE.md §5.4).
//
// A PC carries a segment, and a compiled body bakes the segment it was
// compiled for into every link, EPC, fetch tag and store PC. The home compile
// is the image's link segment. A seed that names the image's bytes in another
// segment (a segment-qualified seed, §10 decision 3) asks for a variant: the
// home functions that seed reaches through direct edges (calls, tail jumps,
// split pieces, fallthroughs, CPS continuations), compiled again in that
// segment. Direct control flow never changes segment (§2), so that closure is
// everything the variant can reach without going through dispatch.
//
// A variant is compiled through a segment view of the image: the same bytes
// with the header moved into the variant's segment. Its code identity is then
// the variant VA (§5.1: func_A00100F0), the CodeGenerator's code segment is the
// view's, and every PC it bakes is in that segment. A KSEG1 variant is charged
// a fetch per instruction by #429's rule (§5.6) with no emitter change.

// exact-match site whose physical address lies in the image, in any segment
// that maps RAM, therefore moves into the view's segment, so every view of
// the same bytes gets the same hooks and substitutions. A KSEG0 view with
// KSEG0-spelled sites (every pre-§5.7 overlay compile) is unchanged. Other
// addresses, the physically matched kinds and every non-site setting are kept.
