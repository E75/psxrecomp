"""Recompiler codegen regression test: a KUSEG-linked EXE compiles for KUSEG,
segment-qualified seeds compile segment variants, and dispatch is exact
(docs/SEGMENT_AWARE_CODE.md §5.3, §5.4, §5.5).

PS1 segments alias the same physical RAM, but a PC carries its segment into
every link value, EPC and I-cache tag. Most PS-X EXE headers carry KSEG0
addresses (0x8001xxxx); some carry KUSEG ones (0x0001xxxx: Alien Resurrection
SLUS-00633, Kula World SCES-01000), and the program then runs at KUSEG PCs.

The recompiler used to fold such a header to KSEG0 and look PCs up by physical
address, so every KUSEG PC ran a body that baked KSEG0 links and tags, and a
KSEG0 or KSEG1 alias ran it too. Now:
  - the EXE parser keeps the header's segment (the link segment) and the
    image compiles there: rows, names and the PCs a body bakes are KUSEG;
  - the emitted lookup indexes the physical word and then requires the exact
    PC, so an alias PC with no body of its own misses; psx_game_address_in_text
    stays physical, which sends that segment miss to the interpreter;
  - a seed in the link segment is an entry; a seed for the same bytes in
    another segment is a variant request (§5.4), never folded into the home
    body: the home functions it reaches through direct edges are compiled
    again in its segment, with their own names, rows and baked PCs (a cached
    variant is the home C with the segment swapped; a KSEG1 one is charged a
    fetch per instruction), and several rows then share a physical word in
    both lookup forms. A jump-table case whose value is in another segment
    than its body tail-transfers instead of continuing locally, in a variant
    and in a home compile alike. A variant closure that reaches a data stub
    compiles it with no dispatch row, and one that reaches an alias entry
    compiles its whole alias group, whose shared body every shard can call
    through the declarations header. A variant seed that names no home
    dispatch entry, or that lies in a segment that does not map physical
    memory (0x20000000-0x7FFFFFFF, KSEG2), stops the build;
  - a header whose entry and load address are in different segments is
    rejected, a KSEG1-linked image compiles as uncached (a fetch charge per
    instruction), and a config code site in a foreign segment is refused.

The RAM-mirror contract is pinned against the runtime's real geometry
(runtime/src/psx_ram_geometry.c, linked in): a PC in the 2nd-4th RAM mirror is
a different code address, in retail 2 MiB and 8 MiB geometry alike, so it never
resolves to a compiled body and never counts as EXE text.

Exit 0 = PASS.
