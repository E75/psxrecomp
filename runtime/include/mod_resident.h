/*
 * Resident disc resources for title-owned seamless-loading adapters.
 *
 * A seamless loader serves a game's blocking loads from memory instead of the
 * emulated drive, with the game's own code still consuming every byte. The
 * title-independent half lives here: read the listed files from the effective
 * (mod-patched) disc once, optionally derive data from them with the title's
 * own decoders, verify everything with SHA-256, and keep a cache that is
 * reused only by the exact same mod plan. The adapter keeps its loader hooks,
 * its catalog and its decoders.
 *
 * Cache key: SHA-256 over the active mod plan fingerprint, the adapter's
 * format id and the complete spec (paths, stock sizes/hashes, policy). Every
 * blob is re-verified when a cache is loaded; a mismatch rebuilds it. Packs
 * live in LOCALAPPDATA (or XDG_CACHE_HOME / ~/.cache)/<title>/seamless, or in
 * PSX_RESIDENT_CACHE when set. Only files named <format>-*.pack are pruned.
 *
 * Call psx_resident_prepare() from an activation callback (it reads the disc
 * through psx_mod_read_disc_file). Accessors are emulation-thread only.
 * A cache that cannot be written (no cache directory, read-only or full disk)
 * does not fail preparation: the pack is kept in memory for this launch, so
 * the outcome depends only on the effective disc and the plan (two netplay
 * peers with the same plan always take the same loader path).
 * TCP: {"cmd":"resident_status"} lists every prepared pack;
 * {"cmd":"resident_events"} returns the always-on service ring.
