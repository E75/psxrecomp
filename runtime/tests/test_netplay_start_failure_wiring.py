"""Guard that a failed netplay start says what failed.

The start printed "built without recomp-net, or bind/peer invalid" for every
failure. A player whose system held the UDP port read first that the build
had no netplay, and a match started from the launcher closed the program with
no text. main.cpp now does the library's steps again, reports the system's
answer, and takes a launcher match back to the room with the sentence. The
sentences are tested in test_netplay_exit_reason.c; a refused bind needs a
held port and the launcher path needs a room, so that main.cpp probes, prints,
stops a command-line start and returns a launcher match is checked in the
source.
