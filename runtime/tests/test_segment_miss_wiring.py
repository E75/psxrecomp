"""Segment misses are recorded at dispatch and reach every surface.

docs/SEGMENT_AWARE_CODE.md §5.5 (§10 decision 2): a PC in the EXE's text whose
physical word has a compiled row only in another segment is a segment miss. It
runs interpreted through dirty_ram_dispatch_inner's clean-text-miss path and is
recorded, so the run names each (segment, entry) that needs a seed.

The classification and the ring are unit-tested (test_psx_segment_miss.c,
psx_segment_miss_note included). What a unit test cannot see is the wiring
inside the runtime, which only runs in a full build: deleting the dispatch
hook, the TCP command or a report field would leave every other test green
and make segment misses silent again. This guard pins that wiring and the
`segment_misses` row shape, whose `kind` tells a game segment miss from a
BIOS one (the compiled BIOS ran a window's home body for another segment's
alias PC; bios_segment_variants compiles and queries that emitted check).
