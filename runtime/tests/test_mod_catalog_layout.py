"""Guard the staged mod-catalog layout (<exe-dir>/mods/bundled).

WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
--------------------
Framework commit 4cc04be3 renamed the staged mod catalog from mods/packages to
mods/bundled. The framework's own staging followed, and the shared release
module (tools/release_overlay_stage.ps1, Add-ModCatalog) followed. Five title
CMakeLists did not, because the only thing coupling them to the framework was a
`cmake -E copy_directory` DESTINATION STRING -- no symbol, no header, no link
dependency. Nothing failed to configure, compile or link. The five titles kept
writing their packages into mods/packages, where nothing reads them, and the
defect surfaced only when a release packager ran, in a different repository, on
a later day (bead beads-eio.3.101).

runtime/psx_check_mod_catalog.cmake is the tripwire that makes that state a
build failure. This test exercises it against on-disk fixtures, including a
byte-for-byte reproduction of the broken state as it actually appeared in Ape
Escape's build output: mods/bundled holding the four framework psx.* packages
and mods/packages holding the four game-owned ape.* ones.

It also pins two source invariants in runtime.cmake, so the layout cannot drift
back into per-title copies:
  * the framework declares PRELOADED_MODS_DIR and stages the title's catalog,
  * the build-time guard is registered through cmake_language(DEFER), which is
    what lets it validate the sibling runtime targets in one output directory.
