/* netplay_bios_settle.h — which BIOS every peer boots for a netplay match.
 *
 * Each seat offers what it can boot: the bundled OpenBIOS and/or one retail
 * image, named by the CRC-32 of the file it would actually load. The host
 * settles one BIOS for the room from those offers and sends the result to
 * every peer, which then boots only that image.
 *
 * The wire token for retail is still "scph1001" so older peers read it, but it
 * means "the retail image named by retail_crc", not SCPH-1001. Before this rule
 * the token was the whole identity: an SCPH-5552 peer and an SCPH-1001 peer
 * both offered "scph1001", each booted its own dump, and the rollback boot
 * digest never matched.
 *
 * Rule (netplay_bios_settle):
 *   1. Retail is possible only when every seat offered a retail image and all
 *      the CRCs are equal. A seat with no offer, no dump, or no CRC (an older
 *      client) makes retail impossible.
 *   2. Retail wins when it is possible and the host prefers it, or when nobody
 *      prefers OpenBIOS.
 *   3. Otherwise OpenBIOS, when every seat that sent an offer links it. A seat
 *      with no offer is an older client and is assumed to link it, as before.
 *   4. Otherwise retail, if it is possible.
 *   5. Otherwise there is no BIOS every seat can boot: the host must not start.
